# SOC-2 Readiness Statement

BookFlow has implemented foundational technical and governance controls aligned with SOC-2 Trust Services Criteria.

While BookFlow has not yet undergone a formal third-party SOC-2 audit, internal controls covering security, availability, confidentiality, and processing integrity are in place and documented.

This readiness posture allows BookFlow to:
- safely serve enterprise customers
- respond to due-diligence requests
- transition efficiently into a formal SOC-2 audit when commercially required
