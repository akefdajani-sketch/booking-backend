4️⃣ How to Create a Tenant-Facing Simplified Version

(Non-technical, zero jargon, trust-building)

Goal

Tenants should understand the rules without knowing the system.

Step 4.1 — Reduce to 5 plain-English truths

Example:

You can always rename services, staff, and resources.

If something was used in a booking, it can’t be deleted.

Retired items won’t appear for new bookings.

Retired items don’t count against your plan.

Past bookings are never changed.

That’s it. No DB talk. No tech.

Step 4.2 — Write it as a help article or modal

Example tenant copy:

Why can’t I delete this item?

To protect your booking history, items that have already been used can’t be deleted.

You can retire them instead, which removes them from future bookings without affecting past ones.

Step 4.3 — Decide where it lives

Choose one (or more):

Help Center article

Tooltip next to Delete button

First-time modal when a delete is blocked
